## Given head of a linked list, return middle node
```java
public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
    ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
    
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    
    return slow;
}
```

## Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
a b c d e f g h i
^ |   ^
n = 3
len = 9
nth from end is len - nth + 1 from start, 3rd from end for length 9 is 7th from start.
```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode frwd = head;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++ ) fwd = fwd.next;
    
    ListNode back = head;
    while (frwd != null) {
        frwd = frwd.next;
        back = back.next;
    }
    
    back.next = back.next.next;
    
    return head;
}
```

## Given a singly linked list and a number k. Find the (n/k)th element, where n is the number of elements in the linked list. We need to consider ceil value in case of decimals.
