## What is multithreading?
- Independent tasks can run simultaneously, because they don't rely on each other for completion.
- Multithreading is a programming technique which runs multiple such chunks of a single program concurrently.
- This means several different components of a program seemingly get performed at the same time.
- Thus improving resource utilization and reducing idle time, hence increasing performance and responsiveness.
- It has immense benefits when used, especially in a program with different independent components of both I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive type, which can be broken down into parallelizable tasks.

## What is parallelism?
Imagine you are working on a machine with two cores. One is handling your web browser tasks like rendering, making HTTP requests, coordinating with internet utilities to get a response, etc. The other is handling your work on a calculator. Both of these tasks are getting independently and simultaneously performed on a separate core dedicatedly available. This is called parallelism. Tasks running in parallel on a separate core.

Imagine you're using a machine with two cores. One core is handling your web browsing task, while the other core is performing some calculations. In this scenario, both tasks are being executed simultaneously because each core is dedicated to a specific task. This is called parallelism. Both tasks run in parallel on separate cores.
